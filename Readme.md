### Objective

The objective of this repo is to document all programming related learnings. We primarily use Python Language but we could easily include other languages in future such as Golang, Scala.

The goals that we would like to concentrate on are as follows:
- Optimization and Code Efficiency
- Industry Grade Software Engineering Principles
- Continuous Skill Development
